**Scope of Project/Packages**
This project supports the calculation of precision maps to quantify uncertainty in structure-from-motion photogrammetric reconstructions, and the propagation of these uncertainties to robustly inform change detection analyses (after James et al., 2017).

A python workflow to create precision maps with Agisoft MetaShape.



**SFM_Precision Module:**



SFM_PCP text here...



**PointCloud_Stat *(We need a better name)*:**

make: Digital Surface Models (DSM), SFM Precision Raster, Height Change Map (with consideration of Precision and 
Roughness to determine limit of detection(LOD))
