### DEMofDiff module

blah... blah...

### Plotting module

This hasn't been made yet but need to make a module that can create simple plots with all the 
necessaries. Also need to create something to export histograms for Precision Analysis.

####OLD
**Create_Prec_Raster.py** is an example of creating a precision map (raster) from the precision point cloud. NB. this  
cannot be combined into the MetaShape script because the required modules cannot be imported into the Metashape  
environment. Other point2grid approaches could be used for this, and it is essential for users to specify the  
parameters used (e.g. spatial resolution etc.) suitable for their application.
