This SS directory contains relic files that were at one time useful.
Provide some working to get my head around the Welfords Algorithm.

**SS/original_precision_estimates.py** is the original python script published by James et al. (with some minor changes  
for running from cmd and testing). Produces a folder with all Monte Carlo outputs and additional output info  
(some of which is not relevant here...).


This can be deleted in future but not quite sure where to put it yet so please leave here for now...
